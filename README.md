# Hall Booking API

This API allows managing room creation, booking, and retrieving booking details for a hall booking system. 
Key features include creating rooms with amenities, booking rooms while preventing double bookings, and listing all rooms and customer bookings.
The API is built with Node.js and Express, and uses in-memory storage for simplicity. To test the endpoints, use Postman before deploying the server on Render.
